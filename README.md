Wordnet
=======================
WordNet is a semantic lexicon for the English language that is used extensively by computational linguists and cognitive scientists; for example, it was a key component in IBM's Watson. WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets and describes semantic relationships between them. One such relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym (more general synset). For example, a plant organ is a hypernym of carrot and plant organ is a hypernym of plant root.

The WordNet digraph. Your first task is to build the wordnet digraph: each vertex v is an integer that represents a synset, and each directed edge v→w represents that w is a hypernym of v. The wordnet digraph is a rooted DAG: it is acyclic and has one vertex—the root—that is an ancestor of every other vertex. However, it is not necessarily a tree because a synset can have more than one hypernym. A small subgraph of the wordnet digraph is illustrated below.
